## Description

There are many independent platforms dedicated to providing reviews for various restaurants, products, and locations. However, there aren’t many independent platforms dedicated to reviews on books, music, and movies. This project aims to provide a platform to read/write reviews regarding books, music, and movies that aren’t cherry-picked by certain parties or limited only to a certain population. Moreover, this project aims to connect related media together in hopes of providing the user a more holistic approach to reviewing pieces of media.
